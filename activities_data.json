From the very start, we knew that this was the place for us.&nbsp;All the students take it seriously and it shows in everything they do. My daughter (who is an only child) describes her dance friends as sisters.&nbsp;We love the community of kids and parents. Ms. King brings the community together with her professionalism, humor, and warmth. We love CKDS!!!!!</p>\r\n",
